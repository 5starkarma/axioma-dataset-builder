TODO: coding
    - Make builder work immediately when pulling from git
        - Project path Root like django
    - Allow Train/Val sets to be created at once
    - Allow multiple games to be created at once
        - Path for each game should be different
        - Might want to move class list/settings for each game into own yaml
